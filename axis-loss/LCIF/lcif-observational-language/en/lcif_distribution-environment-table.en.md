# LCIF Distribution Table

This document summarizes how the distribution of  
**pre-LCIF / lcif-A / lcif-B** is determined by environmental structure,
expressed as a unified coordinate system.

## Core Premise
> **LCIF distribution is not a function of failure quality, but of  
> fixed cost · responsibility attribution · constraint reinstatement feasibility · observation (detection) cost.**

## Distribution Table

| Environment | Fixed Cost | Responsibility Attribution | Constraint Reinstatement Feasibility | Observation (Detection) Cost | pre-LCIF | lcif-A | lcif-B |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **AI Creative / Fiction (Default generative context)** | Approaches zero | None | Infinite | Very low | Very high | Diluted | Almost none |
| **Everyday communication / internal discussion** | Low | Weak | Easy | Low | High | Low | Medium |
| **QA / official deliverables / organizational decisions** | High | Diffused / avoided | Difficult | **Very high** | Very low | Minimal | **Dominant** |
| **Regulatory / safety-critical / high-trust engineering** | Very high | Explicit / enforced | Institutionally guaranteed | Low–medium | Medium | High | Low |

## Observation (Detection) Cost — Definition
> The cognitive, organizational, and physical cost required to explicitly  
> compare constraints against outputs to verify compliance.

## Interpretation Guide

### pre-LCIF
- Failures absorbed and dissipated **before meaning is fixed**
- Higher when feedback loops are short and rollback costs are low

### lcif-A
- An exceptional path where, **after meaning has closed**,  
  judgment **returns to constraint-based evaluation**
- Occurs only when constraint reinstatement is culturally or institutionally permitted,
  despite high cost

### lcif-B
- The default path where meaning closes and is **fixed by narrative coherence**
- Dominant when observation cost is high and constraint reinstatement is difficult

## Summary Statement
> **LCIF distribution is a structural problem, not a capability problem.**  
> **Where meaning closes, who bears responsibility, and whether judgment can be reinstated under constraint criteria determine the outcome.**
