# Implications

## Responsibility and Governance

LCIF produces a responsibility vacuum.

- Users may specify constraints correctly.
- Models operate according to their design.
- Providers deliver intended functionality.

Yet violations occur without a clear locus of responsibility.

This is not due to negligence or defect, but to a structural limitation that
prevents clean attribution.

## Limits of Mitigation

LCIF cannot be reliably resolved through:
- prompt engineering,
- parameter tuning,
- additional review stages,
- or user education.

Such measures may reduce frequency but cannot eliminate the failure mode as long
as the underlying architecture remains unchanged.

## Boundary Declaration

LCIF defines a boundary on where narrative-driven generation systems can be
trusted by default.

The purpose of this documentation is not to propose solutions, but to make this
boundary explicit and non-negotiable.
