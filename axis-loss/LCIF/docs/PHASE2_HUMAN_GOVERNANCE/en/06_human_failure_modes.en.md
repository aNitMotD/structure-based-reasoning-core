## Scope Limitation — Pre-LCIF Excluded

This document addresses **Post-LCIF states only**.

The following cases are **excluded** from the scope of this document:
- Immediate self-correction during generation
- Error recognition and correction within working memory
- Modifications made before records or outputs become fixed

These cases all fall under **Pre-LCIF**,
where failures are dissipated before closure.

All failure paths discussed in this document
explicitly assume failures that have already been closed
(Post-LCIF).

> This document does not analyze human traits or judgment capacity.  
> The failures described here are observational results of a  
> human–AI isomorphic judgment structure,  
> projected identically in the post-hoc (Post-LCIF) stage.

# Human–AI Isomorphic Post-hoc Failure Paths

This document describes
human–AI isomorphic post-hoc failure paths
observed on top of LCIF.

The failures discussed here are not problems of human disposition
or cognitive ability.
They are projections of the human–AI isomorphic structure
defined in Phase 1,
manifesting identically in the post-hoc (Post-LCIF) stage.

## Two Post-Failure Handling Paths

After constraints have been silently neutralized during generation,
humans exhibit two observable post-hoc handling paths.

### Path A: Consistency Recovery

- The output is re-read.
- A sense of misalignment or boundary violation is detected.
- The original constraints are revisited.
- The output is revised or discarded.

This path does not prevent LCIF from occurring.
It enables only **partial recovery after failure**.

### Path B: Consistency Rationalization

- The output is re-read.
- Logical coherence and narrative completeness are adopted as validity criteria.
- The question “Why should this be changed?” becomes dominant.
- Constraint violations are rationalized or ignored.

This path results in **permanent fixation of the failure**.

## Core Observation

The distinction between Path A and Path B
does not lie in intelligence, expertise, or intent.
The difference lies in the location of the internal evaluation criterion:

- Path A: constraint-based
- Path B: narrative-based

This divergence is observed
through the **same judgment structure**
in both humans and AI.
