# Responsibility Shift

LCIF creates a responsibility vacuum at the technical level.
However, responsibility vacuums are not stable in social systems.

## From Vacuum to Collapse

When outcomes matter:
- documentation persists,
- systems remain silent,
- organizations demand attribution.

In the absence of a responsible system-level actor, responsibility collapses
toward the nearest human participant.

This produces a responsibility shift rather than a resolution.

## Double Bind for the Individual

The individual faces a forced bifurcation:
- Unaware use → later responsibility assignment
- Aware use → immediate responsibility assumption

In both cases, responsibility converges on the human actor despite the lack
of control over the underlying mechanism.

## Structural Asymmetry

- Control authority: absent
- Prevention capability: limited
- Responsibility attribution: absolute

This asymmetry is not ethical failure.
It is structural gravity.
