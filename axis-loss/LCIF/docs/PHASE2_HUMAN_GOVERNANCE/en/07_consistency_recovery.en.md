# Consistency Recovery

LCIF does not imply that correction is impossible.
It implies that correction is not automatic.

## Post-Hoc Recovery

Consistency recovery occurs only after:
- the failure has already passed generation,
- the output has already achieved narrative coherence.

Recovery depends on a human actor performing explicit constraint comparison.

This process:
- cannot be delegated to the system,
- cannot be guaranteed by process,
- cannot be automated within the current paradigm.

## Cost of Recovery

Even when recovery is possible, it carries significant cost:
- sustained meta-cognitive load,
- repeated re-verification,
- responsibility concentration on the human actor.

Recovery restores correctness, but not comfort.

## Non-Solution Warning

The existence of recovery does not negate LCIF.
It only shifts the burden from system to individual.

Treating recovery as a “solution” results in responsibility inversion.
