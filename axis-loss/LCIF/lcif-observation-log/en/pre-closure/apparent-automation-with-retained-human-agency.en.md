# Apparent Automation with Retained Human Agency

## Summary
This document records a structural pattern where
a workflow appears automated from its outcome,
despite all decisive control points remaining under explicit human responsibility.

---

## Observed Pattern
In certain AI-assisted or script-driven workflows:
- execution is fast and repeatable
- intermediate decisions are not externally visible
- results resemble those of fully automated systems

As a consequence, observers often conclude
that the system performed automated decision-making.

---

## Actual Responsibility Structure
Despite surface appearances:
- execution is manually triggered
- inputs are explicitly provided by a human
- execution context is selected by a human
- process paths are chosen via human interaction

The system performs only continuous execution,
without decision authority or branching autonomy.

---

## Structural Characteristics
- responsibility is preserved but not surfaced
- decision points are compressed into trivial interactions
- output presentation erases evidence of human agency

Responsibility remains intact,
while its visibility collapses.

---

## Common Misinterpretations
- “This workflow is automated.”
- “The system decided on its own.”
- “Human intervention is optional or incidental.”

These interpretations arise from **outcome-based inference**,
not from actual delegation of responsibility.

---

## Notes
This document records a structural perception pattern only.
It does not propose automation strategies,
design improvements, or mitigation steps.

This observation may appear similar to certain edge cases,
but differs in that constraint inheritance failure is not closed
and judgment remains intentionally withheld.
