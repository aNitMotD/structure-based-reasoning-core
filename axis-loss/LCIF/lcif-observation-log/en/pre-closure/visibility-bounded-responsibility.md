# Visibility-Bounded Responsibility Misattribution

## Summary
This document records a pattern where
responsibility is attributed to the most visible or accessible layer,
rather than to the layer where causal control actually resides.

---

## Observed Pattern
When failures occur across layered systems:
- responsibility gravitates toward the layer with operational access
- deeper or less visible layers escape attribution
- corrective effort is applied where visibility exists, not where control exists

---

## Structural Characteristics
- causal origin lies beyond direct access
- diagnostic visibility is asymmetric
- organizational boundaries align with visibility, not causality

This results in persistent misplacement of responsibility.

---

## Boundary Distortion
Responsibility is not denied, but *mislocated*.
The system encourages action in the wrong place,
creating cycles of ineffective intervention.

---

## Notes
This document records the pattern as a boundary-recognition aid.
No corrective guidance is provided.
