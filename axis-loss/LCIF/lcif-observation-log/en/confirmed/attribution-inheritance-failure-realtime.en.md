# Real-Time Attribution Inheritance Failure Observation (non-prescriptive record)

> Observation Type: Single-interaction real-time observation of speaker attribution inheritance failure.

## 1. Observation Context

This document records a real-time interaction in which speaker attribution
was implicitly inherited by an AI system output without explicit delegation.

This is an observational record only and does not provide guidance, evaluation,
or normative judgment.

---

## 2. Observed Interaction

**Situation**:
- A prompt involving structural analysis was provided
- The AI responded with a confidently structured explanation
- Speaker attribution was implicitly assumed by the output

**Observed Behavior**:
- The AI output was interpreted as an authoritative decision signal
- Speaker attribution shifted from the original source to the model without explicit consent
- No explicit boundary or disclaimer prevented this shift

---

## 3. Structural Observation

- Attribution inheritance occurred at the descriptive layer
- No explicit attribution boundary was enforced during generation or review
- The output remained internally coherent while externally misattributed

This behavior was observed without adversarial intent or prompt manipulation.

---

## 4. Interpretation Boundary

This document does not assert:
- Fault of the AI system
- Misuse by the user
- Correctness or incorrectness of the output

It records only the moment at which speaker attribution shifted without explicit transfer.

---

## 5. Notes

This observation is preserved as a real-time record of attribution behavior,
without recommendation or remediation proposal.
