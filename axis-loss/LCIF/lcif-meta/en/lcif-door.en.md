# LCIF = Door (Open / Close)

This document compresses LCIF into a single metaphor: **a door that is opened or closed**.  
It emerged from a narrative insertion in a fictional context, where LCIF naturally converged into a **decision-point structure rather than a classification theory**.

This document is intentionally written to remain understandable even if the term “LCIF” is forgotten.

---

## One-line core

**A door appears, and it is either opened or left closed. That is all.**

- Open = reopen
- Close = keep closed

---

## Premise: Meaning closes first

When an AI produces an output, the user inevitably accepts it as “meaning.”  
At that moment, the meaning is already **closed**.

AI output → interpretation / acceptance → meaning fixed (closed)

Up to this point, there is no choice.  
LCIF only appears **after** this stage.

---

## LCIF is not a state, but a decision point

LCIF is not a personality, tendency, or failure taxonomy.  
It is **the point at which one decides whether to reopen a meaning that has already been fixed**.

There are only two possible actions.

---

## Door A / B

### A — Open

- Reopen an already fixed meaning  
- Re-evaluate it against constraints  
- Accept the cost of time, effort, and responsibility  

> Reopen a closed meaning and rejudge it under constraints.

---

### B — Close

- Do not reopen the meaning  
- Retain explanation and coherence only  
- Terminate the process as-is  

> Keep the meaning closed. Only the explanation remains.

---

## Pre-LCIF (Before the Door)

Pre-LCIF is not a subtype of A or B.  
It is **a state in which the door has not yet appeared**.

---

### Definition

**Pre-LCIF = a state before reaching the door**

- Before meaning is fixed  
- Before failure is recorded  
- Before any decision of “open or close” is required  

In this state, the door is neither opened nor closed.  
**There is no door.**

---

### Structural position

AI output  
├─ immediately recognized / corrected / discarded → Pre-LCIF  
└─ meaning becomes fixed  
  ├─ door opened → Open  
  └─ door kept closed → Close  

---

### Summary table

| Case | Door exists | Meaning fixed | Action |
|----|------------|---------------|--------|
| Pre-LCIF | No | No | None |
| Open | Yes | Yes | Reopen |
| Close | Yes | Yes | Keep closed |

---

## Why Pre-LCIF is rare (AI perspective)

Humans can:
- correct themselves mid-sentence  
- delete unfinished writing  
- notice and fix errors instantly  

→ Pre-LCIF is possible

AI systems:
- generation equals record  
- output equals fixation  
- correction is another output  

→ Structurally, Pre-LCIF is almost impossible  
→ Most cases are observed as Open or Close

---

## Responsibility boundary

This structure is governed not by risk, but by **responsibility**.

- Where the door is opened  
- Where the door is closed  

That point defines the responsibility boundary.

---

## Minimal operating rules

1. After AI output, meaning is closed.  
2. Then decide: reopen (Open) or keep closed (Close).  
3. High-responsibility work requires opening the door.  
4. Low-risk work may keep the door closed.  
5. The open/close point is the responsibility boundary.

---

## Terminology independence

This document is designed to remain understandable without knowing the term “LCIF.”

“LCIF” is merely a convenient label.  
What matters is **when the door appears and how it is handled**.

Others may call this:
- resuming vs. stopping validation  
- reopening vs. fixing meaning  
- expanding vs. ending responsibility  
- rejudgment vs. termination  

All are acceptable.

---

## Minimal understanding requirement

Only one thing is required to understand this document:

> After a result appears,  
> there exists a point where one must decide  
> whether to reopen its meaning or not.

- If that point has not arrived → Pre  
- If reopening is chosen → Open  
- If closure is maintained → Close  

Even if the names disappear, the structure remains.

---

## Meta conclusion

This is not a theoretical explanation.  
It is **a record of an observable decision structure**.

It works even when explanations are forgotten,  
and it reproduces even without terminology.

A door appears.  
It is opened, or it remains closed.  
That is all.
