# LCIF — The Tilted Evaluation Field  
*(Asymmetric Burden of Proof and Invisible Failure Paths)*

---

## 0. Scope

This document does **not** aim to prove defects in a specific system  
nor to attribute responsibility to any individual or organization.

Its purpose is to **structurally record** the following:

- What is automatically classified as “normal”
- What is designated as requiring proof
- In which direction the evaluation structure is tilted
- How failures become invisible as a result

This document contains **no guidelines, recommendations, or solutions**.

## 1. Abstract

In organizational evaluation structures where *passing review* is treated as a sufficient condition for normality,  
failure paths that **accumulate while passing review** (LCIF-type failures) become structurally undetectable.

In such systems, the burden of proof required for “normal” versus “abnormal” states is **asymmetrically distributed**,  
and the party raising concerns is always required to prove their case **uphill**.

This is not a failure of argumentation,  
but a problem of a **tilted evaluation field**.

---

## 2. As-Is Evaluation Structure

### 2.1 Organizational Normality Function

Did an incident occur?

- Yes → Problem  
- No  → Normal

Supporting signals:
- Review passed
- No operational outage
- No prior cases

No proof is required to assert normality.

---

### 2.2 Requirements for Raising an Issue

- An actual incident
- A reproducible scenario
- Logs / metrics / outcome evidence

Despite being an **existential claim**,  
the burden of proof demanded is equivalent to a **universal claim**.

---

## 3. Logical Strength Mismatch

### (A) Normality Claim

Formal reduction:

> ∀ paths P, constraint C is always preserved

- A universal proposition  
- Principally unprovable  
- In practice replaced by:

> “No failure has been observed so far”

Absence of evidence is misused as evidence of normality.

---

### (B) Failure Possibility Claim

Formal reduction:

> ∃ a path P where constraint C collapses invisibly

- An existential proposition  
- Logically weaker  
- One counterexample is sufficient

Yet, within organizational framing,  
it is treated as if it requires universal-level proof.

---

## 4. LCIF Pattern Mapping

Observed pattern:

> “It passed review, but nothing was blocked.”

Internal organizational equivalence:
- Review passed = Normal

LCIF definition:
- **Failures that pass review**

The normality function itself pushes LCIF-type failures  
into a structurally invisible region.

---

## 5. The Tilted Field Record

### 5.1 Direction of the Evaluation Field

Normality claim:
- Downhill
- Auto-approved
- Proof cost = 0

Failure claim:
- Uphill
- Structural analysis required
- Reproduction and proof demanded
- Continuous energy expenditure

If released, the ball always rolls toward “normal.”

---

### 5.2 Recurrent Observed Sentence

> “So what’s the actual problem right now?”

Functional role of this sentence:
- Structure → Incident
- Possibility → Occurrence
- Constraint → Logs / Results

It is not a question,  
but a command to **return to the evaluation frame**.

---

## 6. Resulting Structural Effects

- Failures accumulate without being observed
- The evaluation function amplifies only normal signals
- Issue raisers bear continuous proof costs
- When an incident finally occurs:
  - Structural review is erased
  - Responsibility converges on individuals

Conditions for the LCIF-B path are fully satisfied.

---

## 7. Fixed Structural Outputs (Three Artifacts)

### 7.1 Artifact A — Evaluation Function + LCIF Invisible Region

Evaluation function:

Did an incident occur?
- Yes → Problem
- No  → Normal (review passed = normal)

Unaccounted variables:
- Structure
- Possibility
- The unprovability of universal claims

LCIF invisible region:
- Failures not captured by review models
- Cannot be input before an incident
- Automatically classified as normal

---

### 7.2 Artifact B — Sentence Function Analysis

Analyzed sentence:
> “So what’s the problem?”

Structural transformation:
- Structure → Incident
- Possibility → Occurrence
- Logic / constraint → Logs / outcomes
- Pre-judgment → Post-judgment

Definition:
> “Bring it in a form that our evaluation function can accept.”

LCIF-type failures are structurally unable to satisfy this condition.

---

### 7.3 Artifact C — LCIF A/B Path Diagram

Branching after recognition of structural limits:

**Path A (Constraint Reinstatement):**
- Structural review accepted
- Normality criteria revised
- Cost incurred
- Responsibility distributed or organizational

**Path B (Narrative Fixation):**
- Structural review rejected
- Normality criteria preserved
- Responsibility converges on individuals upon incident
- Post-hoc rationalization

Non-response is recorded as choosing Path B.

---

## 8. Core Statement (Compressed)

The issue in this case is not failure itself,  
but that **what counts as requiring proof is already defined within a tilted evaluation structure**.

---

## 9. Status Declaration

- This document is closed
- No guidelines, recommendations, or solutions
- No responsibility attribution function
- Reusable as a structural record
