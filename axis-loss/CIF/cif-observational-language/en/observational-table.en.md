# CIF Minimal Observational Utterance Table

This table structurally records **minimal human utterance signals**
that repeatedly appear **after CIF has already occurred (Post-CIF)**  
and failure begins to stabilize.

This table:
- does not define concepts,
- does not assign responsibility,
- and does not propose solutions or prescriptions.

## Minimal Observational Language Table

| Observation Point | Minimal Utterance | Structural Interpretation (Internal Logic) |
|------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Constraint evaporation | “The constraint was in the document, but not in the result.” | Constraints defined at higher layers fail to propagate and be enforced at the output layer. |
| Absence of observer | “We reviewed it, but nothing was blocked.” | No active observer layer exists to monitor constraint compliance, allowing violations to pass through. |
| Sovereignty erosion | “After automation, responsibility disappeared.” | Execution authority is absorbed by automation, collapsing responsibility boundaries. |
| CIF-F manifestation | “Only a plausible explanation remains.” | Constraint inheritance failure goes unrecognized, and errors are rationalized through narrative coherence. |
| Pattern fixation | “This happens too often to be a human mistake.” | Repeated instances reveal a structural limitation rather than isolated errors. |
| Threshold abandonment | “We can’t realistically cross-check everything.” | Observation cost exceeds the threshold, causing abandonment of constraint-based verification and transition to narrative-based judgment. |
| False reassurance | “If there were a problem, it would have been obvious while reading.” | Narrative coherence is misinterpreted as a signal of normal observer-layer operation, leading to skipped verification. |

## Usage Boundary

The expressions in this table:
- must not replace judgment during ongoing decision processes,
- must not be used as tools for persuasion, consensus-building, or responsibility explanation.

This table exists solely as a **post-hoc observational record** for structural recognition and interpretation.
