### Operational Rules

| Observation Point | Usage Rule | Observed Expression | Structural Reading (Internal Logic) |
|------------------|------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| During incident handling | Concept usage prohibited | “The explanation is complete, but no one is acting.” | A language describing post-hoc states replaces active judgment |
| Before judgment closure | Concept usage prohibited | “Understanding is done, but the decision is not.” | A constraint-inheritance explanation prematurely closes an unfinished judgment |
| Responsibility discussion phase | Prohibited for responsibility attribution | “The structure is visible, but the agent disappears.” | Structural description language erases agent attribution |
| Persuasion / consensus attempt | Prohibited as explanation or persuasion tool | “Everyone agrees, yet no decision is made.” | Conceptual understanding substitutes for decision-making, causing consensus to stall |
| Post-incident documentation | Allowed only as a label | “The label is applied, and the judgment is already closed.” | A record-only position that classifies and preserves completed judgments |
