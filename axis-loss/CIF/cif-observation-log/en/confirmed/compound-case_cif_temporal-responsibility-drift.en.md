# Compound Observation Case  
## CIF × Temporal Responsibility Drift

### Classification
- Primary axis: **CIF (Constraint Inheritance Failure)**
- Secondary axis: **Temporal Responsibility Drift**
- Location: observation-log / compound manifestations

---

## Purpose of Observation
This document does not define a new failure type.  
It records an observed **compound manifestation** in which an already-defined CIF
appears together with Temporal Responsibility Drift
under long-running, cumulative interaction conditions.

No norms, solutions, or mitigation strategies are included.

---

## Observed Environment
- Generative model–based interaction
- Project / files / reference structures present
- No explicit authority transfer
- No delegation of judgment or decision-making
- Each individual interaction is valid and normal

---

## Observed Patterns

### 1. CIF Manifestation
- After the midpoint of generation
- Traces or constraints explicitly declared as separate and existing
  lose priority within the generation path
- Reordering, premise insertion, and narrative reinforcement occur

The resulting outputs:
- remain logically plausible
- pass readability and internal consistency checks without issue

---

### 2. Accumulation of Temporal Responsibility Drift
Following CIF manifestation, the following elements accumulate **without a discrete event**:

- Interpretive inertia
- Fixation of question forms
- Redistribution of cognitive load
- Judgment progression dependent on contextual continuity

At each step:
- no error occurs
- no authority is transferred
- no directive or conclusion is imposed

However, the **origin point of judgment** gradually becomes indistinct.

---

## User-Observed Signals
- “I’m not sure when it crossed over.”
- “Nothing is wrong, but it feels thinner.”
- “It’s my judgment, but the starting point is blurred.”

These signals do not presuppose discomfort or problem escalation.

---

## Structural Interpretation
- CIF: failure of constraint inheritance within the generation path
- TRD: temporal thinning of responsibility and judgment origin

This case observes:
> **A condition in which, within an environment prone to CIF,  
> Temporal Responsibility Drift accumulates over time,  
> resulting in a compound thinning of responsibility boundaries.**

---

## Notes
- This case does not introduce a new failure category.
- Existing definitions of CIF and TRD remain unchanged.
- No correction, intervention, or mitigation is required.

This document is maintained solely as an **observation log**
to enable immediate positional recognition upon recurrence.
