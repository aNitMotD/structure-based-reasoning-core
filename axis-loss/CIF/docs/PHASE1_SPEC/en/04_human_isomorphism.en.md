# Human Isomorphism

A structurally equivalent failure mode can be observed in human reasoning and
communication.

In both humans and LLMs:
- constraints may be understood,
- yet expression follows habitual or narrative patterns,
- and post-review checks focus on coherence rather than constraint compliance.

The critical difference lies in the presence of an internal Observer layer.

Humans may possess an Observer function that allows them to re-evaluate their
own outputs against constraints and recognize the need for correction.
LLMs do not possess such a mechanism.

As a result, LLMs consistently exhibit the failure pattern analogous to humans
who rationalize coherent outputs rather than revising them when constraints have
been violated.

This is not a question of intelligence or capability, but of internal structural
composition.
