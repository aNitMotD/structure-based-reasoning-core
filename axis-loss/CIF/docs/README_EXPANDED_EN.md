## Scope Limitation — Pre-CIF Excluded

This document addresses **Post-CIF states only**.

The following cases are **excluded** from the scope of this document:
- Immediate self-correction during generation
- Error recognition and correction within working memory
- Modifications made before records or outputs become fixed

These cases all fall under **Pre-CIF**,
where failures are dissipated before closure.

All observations in this document explicitly assume
failures that have already been closed (Post-CIF).

## (Human–AI Isomorphic Post-hoc Failure)

> This document does not analyze human traits, abilities, or judgment quality.
> The failures described here are not human-specific phenomena,
> but observational projections of the **human–AI isomorphic judgment structure**

---

## Document Position Statement

This document preserves the **structural definition (Phase 1)** of CIF
and expands only its **post-hoc observational layer (Phase 2)**,
while explicitly maintaining the human–AI isomorphism axis across both phases.

It introduces **no prescriptions, recommendations, or mitigation strategies**.
It fixes only interpretive boundaries:
what is observed, and where explanation intentionally stops.

CIF does not describe failures of a particular agent.
It describes how the **same judgment structure**
becomes fixed after failure
when projected onto different agents.

# Phase 1 — Structural Definition

## 1. Definition of CIF

CIF denotes a structural failure mode in which
constraints that were explicitly present and recognized
fail to be inherited or enforced at the generation layer.

The resulting output may remain logically coherent and narratively complete,
and may pass **coherence-based or narrative consistency checks**,
even though constraint satisfaction has failed.

The failure often surfaces only after fixation.

---

## 2. Structural Causes

CIF occurs when the following architectural separations coexist:

- Separation between constraint recognition and generation
- Absence of direct constraint-to-output comparison
- Lack of causal verification at the document or record level

This failure mode is architectural,
not attributable to intent, tuning, or local implementation choices.

---

## 3. Conditions for Failure Validity

CIF is established only when **all** of the following hold:

1. Constraints explicitly existed in the input or context.
2. The generated output was internally coherent and complete.
3. The output became fixed without direct evaluation against constraint satisfaction.

Partial fulfillment does not constitute CIF.

---

## Minimal Preconditions of Working Language and CIF

This section does not redefine or extend CIF.  
It explains **why CIF is structurally easy to trigger**,  
from the perspective of minimal preconditions required for
a language system to function as a *working* medium.

The conditions described here are independent of
grammar, style, preference, or culture.
They represent structural constraints of
**language-as-action**, not language-as-description.

---

### Minimal Preconditions (Observational Set)

The following conditions are observed as the minimal structural
requirements for language to function as an operational
communication act in reality:

1. **Reference Anchoring**  
   Linguistic units must be anchored to at least one
   non-linguistic referent such as an object, state, action, or rule.

2. **Temporal Linearity**  
   The order of interpretation cannot be decoupled from
   the order of events or execution.

3. **Asymmetric Compression**  
   Language does not replicate reality;
   it necessarily exists as a lossy, compressed representation.

4. **Externalization of Ambiguity**  
   Not all interpretive conditions can be closed internally.
   Residual ambiguity is delegated to environment, rules, or context.

5. **Cost Constraint**  
   Utterance, interpretation, and misinterpretation
   all incur cost, which constrains linguistic density and frequency.

---

### Relation to CIF

Observationally,
**violation or collapse of any single condition above**
is sufficient for CIF to become a realizable state.

This is not a normative requirement,
but a description of a **structural sufficiency condition**
under which CIF can be observed.

This section does not propose prevention or mitigation.
It explains **why CIF emerges at an exceptionally low threshold**.

---

## 4. Human–AI Isomorphism

CIF is not unique to AI systems.

Humans likewise:
- recognize constraints,
- close judgments based on coherence,
- and fail to reopen errors after fixation.

CIF therefore represents a **shared judgment-structure failure**
across human and AI agents.

---

## 5. Boundary Declaration

CIF is:
- not an error taxonomy,
- not a responsibility attribution model,
- not a mitigation or solution framework.

It addresses only
**how failures become structurally fixed**.

---

# Phase 2 — Post-hoc Observation (Isomorphic Failure Paths)

> The so-called “human failures” described in this phase are
> post-hoc projections of the human–AI isomorphic structure
> defined in Phase 1.

---

## Two Post-Failure Handling Paths

### Path R — Constraint Reversion After Failure (Exceptional)

- Failure has already occurred.
- Constraint criteria are re-invoked post-hoc.
- Additional cost is incurred to reopen fixed outputs or records.
- Correction, revision, or invalidation takes place.

This path does not prevent CIF.
It represents an **exceptional recovery path**
that prevents permanent fixation.

---

### Path F — Failure Retention and Narrative Fixation (Default)

- Failure is not recognized or is left unchallenged.
- Narrative coherence replaces constraint satisfaction as the validity criterion.
- The question “Why should this be changed?” dominates evaluation.
- Outputs are recorded, summarized, and propagated unchanged.

This path occurs without malice.
In automation- and convenience-optimized environments,
it constitutes the **lowest-energy default post-failure path**.

---

## Core Observation

The CIF failure itself occurs at the generation stage.
The distinction between outcomes arises solely from
**how failure is handled after fixation**.

| Case | Outcome |
|---|---|
| Failure + reversion | Partial recovery (Path R) |
| Failure + retention | Failure fixation (Path F) |

Success and failure are therefore determined
not by output quality,
but by whether a closed failure is reopened
and returned to constraint criteria.

---

## Transition Augmentation — CIF-o / CIF-d (Judgment Alignment Notation)

This section does not extend the definition, validity conditions, or failure paths of CIF.  
This section records **observed differences in judgment alignment at the Post-CIF transition point**,  
using the notation **CIF-o / CIF-d** purely for descriptive convenience.

This notation is used **only within the scope of the expanded document**,  
and does not redefine the top-level axis loss (O/D).

### Purpose of the Notation

In the post-CIF phase, repeated observations show that  
although the failure itself is identical,  
there are differences in **the direction toward which judgment becomes fixed**.

To describe this without introducing new types or branches,  
the following notation is used to succinctly indicate  
judgment alignment at the transition point.

### CIF-o (Externally Oriented Problematization)

- Constraint inheritance failure (Post-CIF) occurs identically
- Judgment becomes oriented toward external entities (AI, system, others)
- Causes, responsibility, and explanations are problematized externally
- This is the most commonly observed alignment in existing CIF cases

In this case, judgment becomes fixed on the question:  
“Why was this output generated?” directed toward an external subject.

### CIF-d (Internally Oriented Justification)

- Constraint inheritance failure (Post-CIF) occurs identically
- Even after the constraint drop is **recognized**,
  externally inserted premises **replace** existing internal constraints
- Judgment becomes fixed in the direction of internal justification

In this case, judgment closes in the form:  
“This premise is now part of my judgment,”  
and the external premise is post hoc absorbed as an internal constraint.

### Structural Position and Limits

- CIF-o / CIF-d do not distinguish whether a failure occurred
- They do not modify the necessary or sufficient conditions of CIF
- They do not replace existing failure paths (R/F)

This notation is used solely to:
- record, **at the Post-CIF transition point**,
- the direction in which judgment becomes fixed,
at the level of observational resolution.

It is not intended for classification, evaluation, norm-setting, or attribution of responsibility.

### Summary

- CIF occurs identically in all cases
- The difference lies in **the direction in which judgment becomes fixed after the failure**
- In the expanded document, this is denoted as **CIF-o / CIF-d**

---

## Responsibility Convergence

In the post-hoc stage:
- AI systems fall silent,
- judgment is attributed to human agents,
- responsibility converges on individuals or organizations.

This convergence is not caused by human deficiency.
It is a structural consequence of
narrative-based judgment fixation
projected onto human actors after automated generation.

---

## Pre-Judgment Responsibility Coordinate Fixation  

> **Status Declaration**  
> This section does not perform legal judgment,
> normative evaluation, or responsibility attribution.
> It fixes the **interpretive coordinates**
> under which recognition and path selection
> may later be read as responsibility
> in a Post-CIF context.

---

### Purpose

This specification enables the following:

- Fixation of whether **risk or problem recognition occurred**
  as a matter of fact
- Preservation of **multiple possible paths**
  without enforcing judgment
- Provision of an interpretive coordinate
  where “there was no awareness” narratives
  become structurally unstable post-hoc

This is neither a defensive nor an accusatory document.  
It is a **coordinate-recording specification**.

---

### Scope

Included:
- Path selection possibility in Post-CIF states
- Field-language-based evidence of recognition
- Chains of reasonable recognizability,
  independent of formal records

Excluded:
- Legal determination
- Responsibility declaration
- Remedies, recommendations, or guidance

---

### Invariant Isomorphic Structure

1. **Recognition**  
   Risk or problem potential is verbalized,
   or a reasonable opportunity for recognition exists.

2. **Judgment-Possible State**  
   At least two alternative paths are identifiable.

3. **Choice as Path Selection**  
   - **CIF-R**: Return to constraint criteria,
     accept cost, revise or discard
   - **CIF-F**: Fixation on narrative coherence,
     rationalization, or convention

4. **Responsibility Attachability**  
   A state in which post-hoc responsibility
   interpretation becomes structurally possible.

> Note: “Choice” refers not to an action,
> but to the **fixation of a post-hoc processing path**.

---

### Relation to CIF

This specification neither causes CIF
nor resolves it.

It fixes only the following:
- Whether recognition occurred
- Whether alternatives existed
- Which path the situation closed upon

This does not transfer responsibility.
It prevents responsibility from being structurally obscured.

---

### One-Line Closure

> **CIF does not apply law.  
> It fixes the coordinates
> where post-recognition path selection
> may later be interpreted as choice.**

---

# Phase 3 — Not Included by Design

This repository does not expand Phase 3.

Organizational or institutional consequences of CIF
are already structurally determined in Phase 2,
and further elaboration introduces no new structure.

Phase 3 therefore exists
not as an analytical target,
but as a **design boundary**.
