## Scope Limitation — Pre-CIF Excluded

This document addresses **Post-CIF states only**.

The following cases are **excluded** from the scope of this document:
- Immediate self-correction during generation
- Error recognition and correction within working memory
- Modifications made before records or outputs become fixed

These cases all fall under **Pre-CIF**,
where failures are dissipated before closure.

All failure paths discussed in this document
explicitly assume failures that have already been closed
(Post-CIF).

> This document does not analyze human traits or judgment capacity.  
> The failures described here are observational results of a  
> human–AI isomorphic judgment structure,  
> projected identically in the post-hoc (Post-CIF) stage.

# Human–AI Isomorphic Post-hoc Failure Paths

This document describes
human–AI isomorphic post-hoc failure paths
observed on top of CIF.

The failures discussed here are not problems of human disposition
or cognitive ability.
They are projections of the human–AI isomorphic structure
defined in Phase 1,
manifesting identically in the post-hoc (Post-CIF) stage.

## Two Post-Failure Handling Paths

After constraints have been silently neutralized during generation,
humans exhibit two observable post-hoc handling paths.

### Path R: Consistency Recovery

- The output is re-read.
- A sense of misalignment or boundary violation is detected.
- The original constraints are revisited.
- The output is revised or discarded.

This path does not prevent CIF from occurring.
It enables only **partial recovery after failure**.

### Path F: Consistency Rationalization

- The output is re-read.
- Logical coherence and narrative completeness are adopted as validity criteria.
- The question “Why should this be changed?” becomes dominant.
- Constraint violations are rationalized or ignored.

This path results in **permanent fixation of the failure**.

## Core Observation

The distinction between Path R and Path F
does not lie in intelligence, expertise, or intent.
The difference lies in the location of the internal evaluation criterion:

- Path R: constraint-based
- Path F: narrative-based

This divergence is observed
through the **same judgment structure**
in both humans and AI.

## R/F Naming Rationale and Positional Clarification

This section does not extend the definition of CIF, introduce new branches,
or perform responsibility attribution.  
It serves solely as a **naming rationale clarification** to specify
what the labels R/F refer to
in post-hoc (Post-CIF) observed handling paths.

### Why R/F Instead of A/B

The former A/B notation functioned as a simple identifier
for post-hoc handling paths,
but left several interpretive ambiguities:

- The paths could be read as **equivalent options**
- They could be misinterpreted as sequential steps or stages
- It was unclear **what exactly differed between the paths**

The labels R/F are used to avoid these ambiguities
and to directly indicate the **direction of judgment-state transition**
observed in post-hoc handling.

---

### Meaning of R (Reopen)

R does not denote a “correct choice,” “recovery,” or “resolution.”

R refers to the following **observed state**:

- A failure has already occurred and has been **closed once**
- That closed judgment is **reopened post-hoc**
- Constraint criteria are re-invoked
- Additional costs are incurred
  (revision, withdrawal, invalidation, etc.)

In other words:

> **R does not indicate a better outcome,  
> but a state transition in which a closed judgment is reopened.**

For this reason, labels such as *Recovery* or *Resolution* are intentionally avoided.

---

### Meaning of F (Fixation)

F does not denote blame or an evaluative judgment of “failure.”

F is observed as follows:

- A failure has already occurred
- In post-hoc evaluation,
  - narrative coherence and completeness,
    rather than constraint criteria,
    become the validity standard
- The judgment remains **closed and fixed**

In other words:

> **F does not indicate an incorrect choice,  
> but a state in which the post-hoc evaluation criterion has become fixed.**

For this reason, labels such as *Failure* or *Freeze* are intentionally avoided.

---

### R/F Are Not “Options”

R/F do not denote:

- actions ❌
- intentions ❌
- normative choices ❌

R/F denote only the following:

> **Observed post-hoc state markers indicating  
> whether a closed judgment was reopened (Reopen)  
> or remained fixed under narrative criteria (Fixation).**

This usage is consistent with the definition applied elsewhere in this document,
where “choice” refers not to an action,
but to the **fixation of a post-hoc processing path**.

---

### Positional Difference: Default Outcome vs. Exceptional Deviation

Observationally, the two paths do not form a symmetric branch.

- **F (Fixation)**  
  - The **default post-hoc outcome**
  - The lowest-energy path in automation- and convenience-optimized environments

- **R (Reopen)**  
  - An **exceptional deviation**
  - Occurs only when additional cost is accepted

Accordingly, the structure is better described as:

- CIF → (mostly) F  
- CIF → (rarely) R  

This distinction does not imply desirability, obligation, or preference.
It describes only **observed frequency and state-transition characteristics**.
