# Pre-Judgment Responsibility Coordinate Fixation
This document does not define the scope or purpose of CIF.
It solely describes the responsibility-attribution coordinate effects that may arise when an observation enters a public or institutional context.

> **Status Declaration**  
> This specification does not perform legal judgment, prescribe norms, or impose obligations.  
> It solely fixes, in advance, the *coordinate at which choices made after recognition may later be interpreted as responsibility attribution*.

---

## 1. Purpose
This specification enables the following *prior to dispute*:
- Fixing the **occurrence of risk recognition** as a matter of fact
- Preserving the existence of **path selection (R/F)** without forcing judgment
- Providing an interpretive coordinate where post-hoc narratives such as “we didn’t know” or “there was a legal gap” become difficult to sustain

This is neither a defensive nor an offensive document. It is a **coordinate-recording document**.

---

## 2. Scope
Included:
- **Path-selection possibility** in post-CIF conditions
- **Field-language-based recognition evidence** from individuals or organizations
- A **chain of reasonable recognizability**, independent of record completeness

Excluded:
- Determinations of illegality
- Assertions of responsibility
- Remedies, prescriptions, or guidance

---

## 3. Invariant Structural Graph

1) **Recognition**  
   A risk or problem possibility was articulated, or there existed a reasonable opportunity for such articulation.

2) **Judgment-Possible State**  
   At least two alternative paths were identifiable.

3) **Choice = Path Selection**  
   - **CIF-R**: Constraint-based return, cost acceptance, correction or discard
   - **CIF-F**: Narrative-based fixation, rationalization, convention adoption

4) **Responsibility Attachability**  
   A state in which post-hoc responsibility interpretation becomes possible depending on the selected path.

> Note: “Choice” does not denote an act, but the **fixation of a post-hoc processing path**.

---

## 4. Role of CIF
- Judgment is **withheld**
- Solutions are **not proposed**
- Only the following are fixed:
  - Whether recognition occurred
  - Whether alternatives existed
  - Which path was closed

This does not *appropriate* responsibility; it renders responsibility *non-concealable*.

---

## 5. Field-Language Evidence Mapping
Even without knowledge of CIF, the following function as **recognition evidence**:
- Statements or messages such as “this could become a problem”
- Requests for risk review, expressions of concern, or alternative proposals
- Records of option rejection or post-hoc modification (hotfixes, wording changes)

What matters is **not the conclusion, but the existence of discussion**.
The existence of discussion simultaneously evidences recognition and alternatives.

---

## 6. Inference Without Records
Complete meeting minutes are not a prerequisite. The following chain suffices:
- A domain where risk is ordinarily foreseeable
- Post-hoc traces of issue raising or modification
- Irreversibility of the selected outcome

Legal interpretation operates on the standard of **reasonable recognizability**.

---

## 7. Non-Prescriptive Guardrails
- No declaration of illegality or responsibility
- No coercion of individual judgment
- No presentation of this specification as a solution

This document exists to **leave a question open**, not to close it.

---

## 8. One-Line Closure
> **CIF does not apply the law.  
> It fixes, in advance, the coordinate at which post-recognition path selection may be interpreted as a ‘choice’.**

---

## 9. Placement
- Advance notices in technical documentation
- Internal review checkpoints
- Post-dispute factual coordinate organization

> Outcome ownership and judgment responsibility always remain with human actors.
