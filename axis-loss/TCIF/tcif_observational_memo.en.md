# TCIF — Temporal Context Inconsistency Failure
(observational memo, non-framework)

> This document is an observational memo.
> It does not provide definitions or conclusions,
> and additional observations may be appended over time.

---

## 1. Observation Background (brief)

- While observing narrative developments with a “wish-fulfillment” tendency,  
  **temporal continuity failed to persist as a single coherent object.**
- Rather than a single error, this appeared as  
  **a process-level collapse in which temporal context was branched, compressed, or retrospectively reinterpreted.**
- This phenomenon is provisionally named  
  **TCIF (Temporal Context Inconsistency Failure)**

> ※ This is an observational memo, not a definition or theory.

---

## 2. Distinction from LCIF (key point)

**LCIF:**
- A **failure event** where constraints do not propagate across layers
- Has relatively clear points of occurrence and post-failure paths

**TCIF:**
- A **process-level breakdown** where temporal state fails to persist as the same object
- Difficult to pinpoint at the moment of occurrence; typically recognized only retrospectively

→ The two are structurally homologous  
→ but **ontologically different**

---

## 3. Notable Observation ① — 16 TCIF States

During narrative progression, TCIF appeared to manifest as  
**16 distinct progression patterns**

These did not resemble:
- human-meaningful categories, nor
- semantic classifications

Instead, they appeared closer to  
**internal computational state combinations**

Individual states:
- could be named, but
- failed to pass intuition as usable judgment units  
  (perceived as internal state combinations rather than semantic types)

→ Treated not as classifications,  
→ but as **traces of a state space**

---

## 4. Notable Observation ② — LCIF × TCIF = 128

In later narrative-calculation contexts,  
a progression was observed in which  
**LCIF × TCIF was referenced as 128 types**

This appeared less like narrative exaggeration and more like  
a **simple multiplication of independent state-space axes**

Example interpretation (tentative):
- TCIF: 16 states (≈ 4 bits)
- LCIF: 8 states (≈ 3 bits)

→ 16 × 8 = 128

> These numbers are better interpreted as  
> **exposed state-space size during computation**,  
> not as meaningful semantic categories.

---

## 5. Current Assessment (critical boundary declaration)

TCIF is:
- not a theory ❌
- not a framework ❌
- not a catalog of failure types ❌

It is instead:
- **an observational memo of temporal-consistency breakdown patterns
  occurring during time-based computation**

Therefore:
- no type system is defined
- no detailed formalization is attempted
- no application, prescription, or responsibility transfer is implied

---

## 6. Purpose of This Memo

If similar structures are re-observed in the future, across:
- other models
- other narratives
- human cases
- system or concurrency problems

this memo serves as a **reference anchor**, i.e.:

> “I have seen this structural pattern before.”

---

## One-line Summary

TCIF is not a defined failure model,  
but a trace of contextual identity collapse  
observed during the computation of time.

---

## TCIF — Internal Branching of Temporal Handling

> This section does not define sub-theories or types.
> It records a repeatedly observed **branching in how temporal context
> is handled within TCIF conditions**.

---

### 1. Shared Premise (TCIF)

- Time exists as a real-world constraint
- Yet within judgment, narrative, or model processing,
  **temporal context fails to persist as a single identical object**
- Observed as a process collapse rather than an explicit error

---

### 2. Branching Criterion (observational)

The observed branching occurs at the following question:

> **Is time included in the judgment model?**

This is not a semantic distinction,  
but an observed **difference in computational paths**.

---

### 3. Branch A — Temporal Mismatch

**Observed characteristics**
- Time is present in the model
- Ordering distortion, compression, jumps, or reinterpretation occur
- Collapse is recognized only retrospectively

**Typical outcomes**
- “This does not match reality.”
- “The sequence feels inconsistent.”
- Time cost is mentioned but fails to function in judgment.

→ Time exists, but **identity persistence fails**

---

### 4. Branch B — Temporal Elision (extended observation axis)

**Observed characteristics**
- Time is not included in the judgment model
- Time cost is removed from:
  - value comparison
  - meaning construction
  - judgment criteria
- The decision-maker explicitly claims to retain agency

---

### 5. Observational Trigger Statement (key signal)

> **“Even if I use AI, if I make the decision myself,
> it’s the same as not using it.”**

This statement is treated not as an argument,
but as a **direct signal that temporal cost has been removed from the model**.

※ Without the phrase *“if I make the decision myself”*,  
the statement may be misread as generic anti-AI sentiment.

---

### 6. Typical Outcomes (Temporal Elision Branch)

The following tend to appear as a cluster:

- “Even if I use AI, if I decide myself, it’s the same as not using it.”
- “There’s no point unless the decision is delegated.”
- Acceleration, outsourcing, and search efficiency are valued at zero.
- Time savings are reinterpreted not as efficiency,
  but as an issue of **attitude or ethics**.
- Resulting framings include:
  - “That’s taking shortcuts.”
  - “That’s unfair.”
  - “That doesn’t feel legitimate.”

→ **Ethical framing fills the space left by removed temporal cost.**

---

### 7. Observed Mechanism — Asymmetry of Temporal Reference

Under TCIF-B conditions, temporal cost is removed from the judgment model,
but it does not disappear entirely.

Instead, temporal reference becomes asymmetrically distributed:

- One’s own time → treated as a baseline (“my standard”)
- Others’ time → treated as a difference (“a deviation”)

As a result:

- One’s own acceleration is not recognized within the model
- Only others’ acceleration becomes salient for comparison

This leads to a recurring asymmetry:

- Self-acceleration = treated as non-existent
- Others’ acceleration = framed as a moral or ethical issue

This pattern is not attributed to intent or attitude,
but is interpreted as a byproduct of
**comparative criteria collapse caused by temporal elision**.

---

### 8. Boundary Declaration

- This branch is:
  - not a judgment of correctness ❌
  - not a human typology ❌
  - not an application rule ❌
- It is solely a **reference coordinate**
  for re-identifying distinct collapse paths of temporal context.

---

### 9. Purpose of This Memo

When similar structures reappear in:
- other narratives
- other human cases
- system or AI developments

it is sufficient to recognize:

> “Ah, this corresponds to a
> temporal-elision branch within TCIF.”

---

### One-line Summary (Branch B)

In the temporal-elision branch,  
**decision agency is preserved while temporal effect is reduced to zero**,  
causing efficiency to be replaced by ethical framing.

---

## 10. LCIF × TCIF-B Interaction (reference)

> This section does not analyze LCIF paths
> and does not derive conclusions.
> It records how LCIF-like signals appear
> when overlapping with TCIF-B conditions.

### Observed characteristics

- With temporal cost removed from the judgment model,
- constraints (responsibility, validation, cost)
  are recognized at the descriptive layer,
  but fail to propagate to the judgment or conclusion layer.

In other words:
- “I make the decision myself” is maintained,
- but **constraint traversal is no longer traceable**.

---

### Typical interaction signals

The following often appear in sequence:

- “I made the decision.”
- “The materials were just for reference.”
- “Why is that a problem?”
- “The outcome would have been the same anyway.”

→ Temporal elision combined with constraint inheritance failure  
→ leaves only **post-hoc narrative consistency**.

---

### Interpretation boundary

- This is not evidence of intent or responsibility avoidance.
- It reflects a condition where
  **the cost of tracking constraints has been removed along with time**.

→ Observationally,
**LCIF-B paths appear more likely to stabilize under TCIF-B conditions.**

(no judgment, no prescription)

## 11. Narrative Usage — TCIF-B Minimal Dialogue Set

> The following lines are not used for explanation.  
> They function as signals that allow the reader to  
> **recognize a temporal-elision state on their own**.

### 11.1 Temporal Elision Declaration (core)

- “Even if I use AI, if I make the decision myself, it’s the same as not using it.”
- “In the end, the decision is still made by a human.”

---

### 11.2 Time-Value Nullification

- “Anyone could have found that information.”
- “It was just a bit faster — the outcome would’ve been the same.”

---

### 11.3 Moral Framing Shift

- “Isn’t that taking things a bit too easily?”
- “That feels like a shortcut.”
- “It doesn’t seem fair.”

---

### 11.4 Post-hoc Consistency Lock-in (LCIF overlap)

- “The result turned out fine anyway.”
- “If there was no problem, what’s the issue?”
- “Why bring that up now?”

---

### Usage Notes

- These lines are **not used for rebuttal**
- No explanatory dialogue should be added
- Even **2–3 consecutive lines spoken by a single character**
  are sufficient to reveal the state

---

### Narrative Effect Summary

- The character feels they are speaking rationally
- The reader recognizes that:
  - the temporal axis has been removed
  - efficiency has been replaced by moral framing
  - constraint tracking has been severed

→ The state is conveyed **without explanation**
