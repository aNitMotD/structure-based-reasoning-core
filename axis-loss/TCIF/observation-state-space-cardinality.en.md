## 1. Why LCIF Was Initially Observed as 2³

In early narrative and structural observations, LCIF consistently appeared as **eight (2³) state combinations**.

This was not the result of semantic classification or intentional design.
Rather, it reflects that LCIF’s failure realization depended on **three independently observable binary conditions**.

The repeatedly observed minimal axes were:

1. **Existence of a constraint**  
2. **Recognition of that constraint**  
3. **Inheritance / execution of that constraint**

Each axis was observed only in a yes/no manner.
As a result, LCIF naturally manifested as a **2³ state space**.

This suggests that LCIF was observed not as an event,
but as the **minimal state space of a constraint-handling structure**.

## 2. Why TCIF Was Observed as 2⁴

TCIF was not observed as a single failure point,
but as a **process-level collapse of temporal context handling**.

Across narrative unfolding and internal computation traces,
TCIF repeatedly surfaced as **sixteen (2⁴) distinct patterns**,
resembling internal state combinations rather than semantic types.

The independently fluctuating temporal axes observed were approximately:

1. **Presence of time as a model object**  
2. **Preservation of temporal identity**  
3. **Inclusion of time cost in judgment**  
4. **Use of time as a comparative criterion**

These axes did not collapse into one another,
nor did the failure of one necessarily imply failure of the others.

Thus, TCIF was observed as the **minimal state space of temporal-context processing: 2⁴**.

## 3. Where 2⁵ Came From

In later observations, LCIF began to appear as if it occupied a **larger state space than 2³**.

This was not due to an expansion of the LCIF definition.
Rather, it coincided with the emergence of **minimal operating conditions of language** as an explicit observational coordinate.

Five such language-level conditions were observed:

1. Reference anchoring  
2. Temporal linearity  
3. Asymmetric compression  
4. Externalization of ambiguity  
5. Cost constraint

These conditions do not subdivide LCIF’s internal states.
Instead, they function as **independent axes that determine whether LCIF can become realizable in practice**.

Accordingly, **2⁵** should be interpreted not as the number of LCIF states,
but as the **minimal state space of language environments in which LCIF can manifest**.

---

## 4. One-Line Relation Between the Three Cardinalities

- **2³**: Minimal state space of constraint handling (LCIF internal)
- **2⁴**: Minimal state space of temporal-context handling (TCIF internal)
- **2⁵**: Minimal state space of language environments enabling LCIF realization

These are **state-space cardinalities observed at different structural levels**.

---

## 5. Why They Are Not Independent

If 2³ and 2⁵ were independent,
LCIF’s three internal axes would remain well-defined regardless of language conditions.

However, observations indicate that when reference anchoring or temporal linearity collapses,
questions such as “did the constraint exist?” or “was it recognized?” become ill-defined.

Thus, **collapse of the 2⁵ space destabilizes the very definition of the 2³ space**.
The two are therefore not independent.

---

## 6. Why This Is Not a Simple Cartesian Product

If the relationship were a simple product (2³ × 2⁵),
all LCIF internal states would combine uniformly with all language-condition states.

Observed behavior contradicts this.
When any language condition collapses,
LCIF does not fragment into finer sub-states;
instead, it merely becomes **realizable as a failure state**.

Thus, the 2⁵ axes operate not as multiplicative dimensions,
but as **gating conditions**.

## 7. Correct Structural Relation: A Gated Subspace

Observed structure is best described as:

[ Language Precondition State Space ^5 ]
              │
              │  (all ≥ threshold)
              ▼
[ LCIF Constraint-Handling State Space ^3 ]

- **2⁵**: Upper-level environmental state space (language operability)
- **2³**: Lower-level state space (constraint handling),
  defined **only within a viable subset of the 2⁵ space**

LCIF’s 2³ states are observable
only when language conditions remain above a certain structural threshold.

---

## 8. The Source of the “2³ → 2⁵ Expansion” Impression

The perceived expansion reflects not a change in LCIF itself,
but a **change in observational resolution**.

- Early observation implicitly assumed stable language conditions and focused on 2³
- Later observation treated language conditions as explicit, unstable axes, revealing 2⁵

Hence, LCIF appeared to “grow,”
when in fact the **observer’s coordinate system expanded**.

---

## 9. Summary

> LCIF’s state space did not expand.  
> The state space of language environments that enable LCIF
> became visible as an explicit observational coordinate.

This memo records an **expansion of observation scope**,
not an extension of definitions.
