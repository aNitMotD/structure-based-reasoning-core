# User Phase Classification

> In this document, the term **phase** does not refer to a sequential level or hierarchy.  
> It denotes a **state of thinking that shifts depending on the problem, environment, and role**.  
> The same person may occupy different phases in different contexts.

## Usage Phase (Universal User)

### Core Capability

- Able to **choose and optimize within a given structure**.

### Structurally Speaking

- Can **use** an existing structure
- Understands input–output relationships of a problem
- Follows predefined rules, procedures, and frames to combine options

### Representative Abilities

- Understands and applies explained rules
- Finds the best option when a goal is given
- Compares, evaluates, and improves efficiency
- Judges “which option is better”

### Key Statement for This Phase

> Most people are good at making choices within already-defined frameworks.

### Characteristics

- Does not need to know why the structure exists
- Does not need to consider alternative structures to function well

## Boundary Awareness Phase (Transitional User)

### Core Capability

- Able to **recognize** a structure and **modify parts of it**.

### Structurally Speaking

- Begins to **be aware** of structure itself
- Understands that rules are not absolute
- Detects the **boundaries** of a structure

### Representative Abilities

- Asks, “Is this rule really necessary?”
- Compares multiple frames
- Detects situations where existing methods fail
- Performs local structural changes (exceptions, bypasses, recombination)

### Characteristic State

- Coexistence of confusion and insight
- Increased demand for explanations and questions
- A sense of mismatch with existing systems

### From a Universal User’s Perspective

> Some people don’t stop at using rules — they begin to question the rules themselves.

---

## Structural Design Phase (Non-Universal User)

### Core Capability

- Able to **create and redefine structures**.

### Structurally Speaking

- Treats structure as an **object**
- Looks at the **conditions that generate problems**, not just the problems
- Can transform and integrate between structures

### Representative Abilities

- Redefines the problem itself
- Creates or merges new frames
- Makes invisible constraints explicit
- Reads and responds to other people’s thinking structures

### Characteristics

- Design precedes explanation
- Questions shift from “What should we do?” to  
  “Why does this appear as a problem at all?”
- May appear abstract to others

### From a Universal User’s Perspective

> Some people don’t just play the game — they design the rules of the game.

## Summary

- **Usage Phase**: Chooses and optimizes within a given framework
- **Boundary Awareness Phase**: Recognizes the framework and adjusts parts of it
- **Structural Design Phase**: Defines and generates the framework itself

Or more casually:

> User → Adjuster → Designer

---

## Important Structural Notes

- Phases are **not hierarchical or value-ranked**
- Each phase requires **different environments and responsibility conditions**
- Not every problem requires all phases simultaneously
- **The Structural Design Phase cannot be sustained in isolation from the Usage and Boundary Awareness Phases**

This document does not describe ability levels.  
It describes a **structure of roles and thinking states**.
