# Boundary Risk Check — Responsibility Dependency (Signal)

This document describes **signals that arise when responsibility converges on a single individual**.  
It captures dependency effects in otherwise stable environments.

## Core Characteristics
- A clearly identified responsibility holder
- Responsibility declaration functions as a stability signal
- Other actors’ judgment intensity decreases

## Typical Signals
- Knowing someone else is responsible creates relief
- Deep personal consideration feels unnecessary
- Personal judgment does not feel final
- Expectation that the responsible person will correct issues
- Individual judgment burden feels reduced

## Structural Position
- Responsibility **converges to a single point**
- Classified as a dependency reaction in stable systems

## Notes
- Responsibility dependency is not irresponsibility
- Clear ownership can paradoxically obscure risk
