# Responsibility Dependency — Quick Check

If **2 or more** of the following come to mind immediately, pause.

- Knowing that someone else is responsible made me feel relieved.
- I felt I did not need to think deeply about this.
- This did not feel like my final judgment.
- I expected the responsible person to correct any issues.
- The burden of my own judgment felt lighter.
- This felt more like a team decision than my own.

Not intended for use beyond quick checking.
