# Boundary Risk Check — Responsibility Transfer (Signal)

This document describes **signals where responsibility shifts after a judgment has been made**.  
It focuses on post-judgment movement of accountability.

## Core Characteristics
- Responsibility migrates away from the decision-maker
- External artifacts act as protective buffers
- Procedure compliance outweighs outcome ownership

## Typical Signals
- “I followed the guideline” becomes the primary explanation
- The decision feels difficult to claim as personal
- Documentation or systems absorb responsibility
- Outcome quality feels secondary to procedural correctness
- Responsibility shifting feels legitimate and natural

## Structural Position
- Responsibility moves **after judgment**
- Classified as a post-judgment boundary reaction

## Notes
- Procedure adherence itself is not a failure
- Responsibility transfer must be distinguished from valid delegation
