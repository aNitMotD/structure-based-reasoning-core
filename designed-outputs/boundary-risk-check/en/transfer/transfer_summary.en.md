# Responsibility Transfer — Quick Check

If **2 or more** of the following come to mind immediately, pause.

- “I followed the guideline” came to mind first.
- It was hard to call this my own decision.
- Following procedure felt reassuring.
- Responsibility seemed transferable to documents or systems.
- Procedure compliance felt more important than the outcome.
- I felt I could shift responsibility when explaining this later.

Not intended for use beyond quick checking.
