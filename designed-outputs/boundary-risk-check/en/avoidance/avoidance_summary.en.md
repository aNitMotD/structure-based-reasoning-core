# Responsibility Avoidance — Quick Check

If **2 or more** of the following come to mind immediately, pause.

- I felt this was not really my responsibility.
- I wanted to hand this decision to someone else.
- I felt there was no reason for me to step in right now.
- Delaying the decision felt safer.
- The thought “why now?” came up first.
- I felt relieved that I did not have to take responsibility.

Not intended for use beyond quick checking.
