# Boundary Risk Check — Responsibility Avoidance (Signal)

This document describes **signals of responsibility avoidance that appear before a judgment is made**.  
It does not provide conclusions, recommendations, or corrective actions.

## Core Characteristics
- An impulse to exit the decision space before judgment
- A tendency to narrow one’s role definition
- Avoidance of ownership prior to explicit responsibility

## Typical Signals
- The thought “this is not really my responsibility” appears first
- Deflection toward someone else feels natural
- Non-intervention feels safer than engagement
- Delay appears more rational than decision
- Responsibility itself feels like an unnecessary burden

## Structural Position
- Occurs **before responsibility is explicitly assumed**
- Classified as a pre-judgment boundary reaction

## Notes
- Responsibility avoidance is not equivalent to incompetence or malice
- This signal is observational, not evaluative
