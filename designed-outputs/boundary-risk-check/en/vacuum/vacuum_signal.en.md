# Boundary Risk Check — Responsibility Vacuum (Signal)

This document describes **signals that appear when no clear responsibility holder is perceived**.  
It does not assign blame or propose remedies.

## Core Characteristics
- Absence of a recognizable responsibility owner
- Judgment appears to be carried by structure or process
- Individual intervention points are unclear

## Typical Signals
- It is difficult to name who is responsible
- The outcome feels like “it just happened”
- Systems or workflows feel like the decision-maker
- Personal judgment feels unnecessary
- Responsibility does not feel required to be stated

## Structural Position
- Responsibility is **structurally absent**
- Classified as a responsibility vacuum condition

## Notes
- Responsibility vacuums often arise unintentionally
- This signal does not imply automation or process failure by default
