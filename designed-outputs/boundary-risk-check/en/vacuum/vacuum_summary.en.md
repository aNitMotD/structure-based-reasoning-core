# Responsibility Vacuum — Quick Check

If **2 or more** of the following come to mind immediately, pause.

- It was unclear who was responsible.
- It felt like things “just happened.”
- The system or structure seemed to make the decision.
- I could not see where an individual should intervene.
- It felt acceptable not to name a responsible party.
- It seemed possible to move on without explanation.

Not intended for use beyond quick checking.
