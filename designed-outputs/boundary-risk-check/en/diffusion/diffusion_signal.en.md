# Boundary Risk Check — Responsibility Diffusion (Signal)

This document describes **signals that emerge when responsibility is spread across multiple actors**.  
It is intended for pattern recognition only.

## Core Characteristics
- Individual judgment dissolves into collective judgment
- Personal accountability becomes ambiguous
- Responsibility weight decreases through distribution

## Typical Signals
- The decision feels like a group outcome rather than an individual one
- Personal responsibility feels diluted
- “We decided together” functions as implicit protection
- Judgment accuracy feels less critical
- Consensus feels safer than ownership

## Structural Position
- Responsibility is **simultaneously distributed**
- Classified as a pre- or co-judgment reaction

## Notes
- Collaboration itself is not a failure mode
- Responsibility diffusion must be distinguished from intentional responsibility sharing
