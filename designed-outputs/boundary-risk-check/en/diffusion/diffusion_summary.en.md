# Responsibility Diffusion — Quick Check

If **2 or more** of the following come to mind immediately, pause.

- This felt like a group decision rather than an individual one.
- Personal responsibility did not feel heavy.
- My judgment felt like just one opinion among many.
- Even if the outcome was bad, it did not feel like my responsibility.
- The consensus process felt more important than the result.
- A judgment error did not seem like a serious problem.

Not intended for use beyond quick checking.
