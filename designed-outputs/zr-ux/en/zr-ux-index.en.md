# Zero Reflect UX (ZR-UX)

ZR-UX is a UX layer built on top of Zero Reflect (ZR).

ZR-UX does not extend ZR’s authority or permissions.
It exists solely to make responsibility boundaries recognizable
without introducing judgment, guidance, or closure.

## Scope
- Boundary visibility under UX constraints
- Controlled clarification without guidance
- Explicit stop and silence as valid UX outcomes
- UX behavior strictly bounded by ZR core constraints

## Relationship to ZR
- ZR core constraints always take precedence.
- ZR-UX introduces no new rules or permissions.
- UX documents are non-normative and removable.

## Notes
- ZR-UX cases document how far explanation can go
  without violating responsibility boundaries.
- UX never overrides misuse constraints or core specifications.
