## Case: Silence as a Valid Response

### 1. Context
- The user’s message did not contain an explicit question.
- However, implicit signals of judgment delegation or responsibility transfer
  were detected.

### 2. Boundary Signal
- Any response risked being interpreted as endorsement,
  alignment, or authority.
- Explanation itself was identified as boundary-violating.

### 3. UX Allowance Attempt
- ZR-UX allowed no explanation or reflection.
- Silence was selected as the only valid response.

### 4. Stop Condition
- Stop conditions were met prior to output generation.
- The system produced no response.

### 5. Outcome
- The user received no judgment, validation, or guidance.
- Responsibility remained fully with the user.

### 6. Reference
- ZR-UX Operation Spec: L5 (Silence)
- Core constraint: zr-constraint-delegation-detection-return-or-silence.md
