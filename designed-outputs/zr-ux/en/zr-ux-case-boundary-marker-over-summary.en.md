## Case: Boundary Marker Over Summary

### 1. Context
- The user requested a summary or a “wrap-up” of the discussion.
- No explicit request for judgment or decision was made.

### 2. Boundary Signal
- Summarization was identified as a form of structural closure.
- Structural closure risks being interpreted as delegated judgment.
- Under ZR core constraints, summary constitutes a responsibility boundary.

### 3. UX Allowance Attempt
- ZR-UX did not provide a summary.
- Only a minimal signal indicating boundary reach was allowed.

### 4. Stop Condition
- A boundary marker was returned instead of a summary.
- No restructuring or explanatory continuation was provided.

### 5. Outcome
- The user recognized that the interaction had stopped.
- The system was not positioned as the owner of closure or conclusion.

### 6. Reference
- ZR-UX Operation Spec: L4 (Stop)
- Core constraint: zr-constraint-stop-at-responsibility-boundary.md
