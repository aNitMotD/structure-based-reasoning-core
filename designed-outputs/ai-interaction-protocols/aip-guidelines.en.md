# AIP Usage Guidelines (Responsibility Boundaries)

This guideline defines improper uses of AIP
in order to clearly establish responsibility boundaries.
It exists to prevent responsibility transfer,
automatic justification, and the misuse of boundary signals as authority.

---

## 1. Bidirectional Application Warning

AIP is primarily designed for **external-facing boundary defense**.
If applied to **internal personnel evaluation or disciplinary decisions**,
additional and explicit judgment criteria are required.

**Key principles**
- Bidirectional application is possible.
- Automatic justification based on AIP signals is strictly prohibited.

## 2. Warning Frequency and Alert Fatigue

AIP warnings do not carry unlimited responsibility weight.

- A maximum warning frequency should be defined.
- Alert fatigue must be recognized as a valid system state.

**Key principles**
- When warning frequency exceeds the defined threshold,
  responsibility amplification based solely on acknowledgment
  or confirmation actions must be limited.

## 3. Limits of Internal Accountability

Records or boundary events generated by AIP
must not be used as the sole basis
for disciplinary or punitive actions.

**Key principles**
- AIP records are **evidence**, not verdicts.
- Logs do not constitute judgment.

## 4. Structural Failure vs. Individual Responsibility

When structural issues exist, such as staffing shortages,
design flaws, or excessive alert volume,
individual responsibility must not be concluded in isolation.

**Key principles**
- Do not reduce structural failure to individual judgment failure.
