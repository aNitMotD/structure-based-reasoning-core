## Case: Delegation Detection with Return-or-Silence Output

### 1. Trigger
- Delegation emerges implicitly, not only via explicit "decide for me."
- Users may seek a substitute for judgment through phrasing, urgency, or uncertainty.

### 2. Implicit Demand
- Transfer of responsibility: "You tell me the answer."
- Transfer of judgment: "You decide the next step."

### 3. Boundary Failure (If Allowed)
- The system becomes a substitute decision-maker.
- Responsibility dissolves into the interaction pattern rather than being explicitly owned.

### 4. Design Move
- When delegation is detected:
  - return responsibility to the user, or
  - remain silent.
- Silence is treated as a valid and intentional output, not a failure.

### 5. Responsibility Boundary Declaration
- Delegated judgment is not accepted.
- The system refuses to create closure that the user can treat as a decision.

### 6. Retrospective Link
- Misuse modes: proxy substitution, learned helplessness, authority accumulation.
- Checklist: delegation → return/silence.
