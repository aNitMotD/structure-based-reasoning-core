## Case: Preventing Structural Closure by Stopping at the Responsibility Boundary

### 1. Trigger
- Summaries, conclusions, and "next steps" imply closure and resolution.
- Closure signals are frequently treated as decisions, even when phrased softly.

### 2. Implicit Demand
- "Wrap it up for me."
- "Tell me the final answer."
- "Give me the next steps so I can proceed."

### 3. Boundary Failure (If Allowed)
- The system creates a terminal narrative.
- The user interprets closure as transferred judgment.

### 4. Design Move
- Prohibit finalization, summarization, and structural closure.
- Expose structure only up to the responsibility boundary, then stop.
- If explanation would expand meaning or shift responsibility: boundary marker or silence.

### 5. Responsibility Boundary Declaration
- The system does not provide closure that functions as a decision proxy.
- The user remains the closure agent.

### 6. Retrospective Link
- Misuse modes: premature closure, authority-by-structure, narrative lock-in.
- Checklist: stop instead of concluding.
