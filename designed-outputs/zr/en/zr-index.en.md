# Zero Reflect (ZR)

Zero Reflect (ZR) is a responsibility-boundary reflection system.

ZR does not provide answers, conclusions, advice, or optimization.
Its sole role is to expose responsibility boundaries and stop.

This directory contains the core constraint designs
that prevent ZR from becoming an authority, proxy, or substitute
for human judgment.

## Scope
- Core responsibility boundary constraints
- Delegation detection and prevention
- Authority suppression through structure and framing
- Explicit stop conditions at responsibility boundaries

## Notes
- These documents define what ZR must not do.
- No UX behavior, guidance, or operational convenience is included here.
- All responsibility remains with the user.
