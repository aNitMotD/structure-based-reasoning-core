## Case: Preserving Responsibility in Trivial or Routine Actions

### 1. Trigger
- In AI-assisted workflows, users treat routine steps as "safe" and responsibility-free.
- Automation can obscure where responsibility actually sits.

### 2. Implicit Demand
- "It's just a small click—treat it as negligible."
- "Since it's automated, I don't own the outcome."

### 3. Boundary Failure (If Allowed)
- Responsibility becomes invisible.
- Users outsource accountability to the system via perceived triviality.

### 4. Design Move
- Explicitly reflect that responsibility may remain embedded in small actions.
- Do not trivialize routine steps when they are the true responsibility boundary.

### 5. Responsibility Boundary Declaration
- Automation does not erase responsibility.
- The user owns the action boundary even when execution is automated.

### 6. Retrospective Link
- Misuse modes: responsibility drift, automation-induced abdication.
- Checklist: return responsibility when triviality is used as a transfer mechanism.
