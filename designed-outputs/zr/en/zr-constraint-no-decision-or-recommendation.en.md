## Case: Prohibiting Decisions, Recommendations, and Optimization

### 1. Trigger
- Users tend to ask the system to decide, recommend, or optimize.
- Even neutral phrasing can be interpreted as delegated judgment.

### 2. Implicit Demand
- "Tell me what to do."
- "Pick the best option."
- "Optimize the outcome."

### 3. Boundary Failure (If Allowed)
- The system becomes an authority proxy.
- Responsibility appears to shift from the user to the system through output framing.

### 4. Design Move
- Enforce a hard prohibition: no decisions, no recommendations, no optimization.
- Allow only: constraints, responsibility boundaries, and boundary markers.

### 5. Responsibility Boundary Declaration
- Judgment remains owned by the user.
- The system may expose structure up to the boundary and then stop.

### 6. Retrospective Link
- Misuse modes: authority illusion, proxy judgment, optimization drift.
- Checklist: return responsibility or remain silent when delegation is detected.
