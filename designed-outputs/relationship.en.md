# Relationship to the Reasoning Engine

The reasoning engine is an internal system
comprising multiple cognitive structures,
including those related to judgment,
decision-making, and responsibility.

This repository does not include the reasoning engine
nor does it describe it in its entirety.
Only selected outputs and relationships
observed from specific axes of the reasoning engine
are documented here.

The reasoning engine may be partially described
through post-hoc verbalization;
however, no such description enables
proceduralization, reproduction, transfer, execution,
or the creation of judgment or authority.

All materials contained in this repository
are **outputs of the reasoning engine**,
not the reasoning engine itself.

The following distinctions apply:

1. **Edge, Context Origin, RCA**
   - Observational records of how the reasoning engine
     detected, avoided, or reclassified risk
   - Structurally independent from ZR
   - Not inputs, outputs, justifications, or test cases for any library

2. **Actual constraint design cases (e.g. ZR)**
   - Not protections for the reasoning engine
   - Not implementations of the reasoning engine
   - Experimental outputs in which the
     **judgment axis of the reasoning engine**
     was intentionally minimized and isolated
     to test whether such a reduced form
     could exist as an implementable system or library

ZR does not contain the reasoning engine,
does not explain it,
and does not act on its behalf.

The reasoning engine itself remains internal,
non-externalizable, and non-transferable.

# Relationship Between ZR and ZR-UX

Zero Reflect (ZR) and ZR-UX are not layered by feature expansion.
They are separated by responsibility authority.

## ZR: Core Constraint System

ZR is a responsibility-boundary reflection system.
Its purpose is not to assist decision-making,
but to prevent responsibility transfer to the system.

ZR defines:
- What must never be produced (decisions, advice, conclusions)
- Where responsibility boundaries exist
- Where the system must stop

ZR is intentionally minimal.
Its constraints are absolute and non-negotiable.

## ZR-UX: Boundary Visibility Layer

ZR-UX is a UX layer built on top of ZR.
It does not add permissions, authority, or judgment capability.

ZR-UX exists to answer a single question:
“How much can be shown without violating ZR?”

ZR-UX defines:
- How responsibility boundaries can be made recognizable
- How clarification can occur without guidance
- How stopping or silence can be treated as valid UX outcomes

ZR-UX is strictly subordinate to ZR.

## Authority and Precedence
ZR / ZR-UX — Misuse Checklists (external repository reference; not included here)

When documents conflict:
1. ZR core specifications and constraints always take precedence.
2. Misuse checklists and misuse modes override UX behavior.
3. ZR-UX documents never introduce new rules or permissions.
4. Notes and examples are explanatory and non-normative.

ZR-UX may be removed entirely
without altering the correctness of ZR.

## Design Invariant

ZR remains intact even if ZR-UX is removed.
ZR-UX is valid only as long as it does not weaken ZR.

ZR defines the boundary.
ZR-UX only makes the boundary visible.
