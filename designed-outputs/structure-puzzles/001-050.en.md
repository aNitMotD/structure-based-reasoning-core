# Structure Puzzles

## What is this?

These are problems.
But they are not really problems.

There are no answers.
No grading.
No hints.

Just read them, and think.
“What is the structure?”

## How to use

1. Read a problem
2. Think
3. Stop

Do not try to find the correct answer.
Try to see the structure.

If you see it, you see it.
If you don’t, you don’t.

That’s all.

## Notes

- No answer key
- No explanations
- Questions will not be answered
- No domain restrictions
- No difficulty levels

## Why was this made?

Because I was bored.

### **#001 [Everyday]**

You go to a café.

There are 5 people in line.
When the 3rd person orders, the 1st person has not received their drink yet.
When the 4th person finishes ordering, the 2nd person receives their drink.

**What is the structure?**

---

### **#002 [Code]**

Function A calls function B.
Function B calls function C.
If function C fails, it directly notifies function A.

This system worked well for 3 years.
One day, a problem appeared.
The code did not change.

**What is the structure?**

### **#003 [Meeting]**

In a meeting:

- A makes a proposal
- B opposes it
- C supports A

D’s proposal is 80% identical to A’s.

**What is the structure?**

---

### **#004 [Sequence]**

1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...

Dividing each term by the previous one gives:
1, 2, 1.5, 1.666..., 1.6, 1.625...

They converge to 1.618...

**Where does this “convergence” come from?**

---

### **#005 [Sentence]**

“This sentence is false.”

If it is true, it is false.
If it is false, it is true.

It is said to be unsolvable.

**Is it really “unsolvable”? Or is the question itself wrong?**

Option A: You get 50 for sure.

---

### **#008 [Map]**

A map is not the territory.

Yet we judge the territory by looking at the map.

If the map is wrong,  
is the territory wrong?  
Or is the map wrong?

**How do we tell the difference?**

---

### **#009 [Translation]**

Korean: “밥 먹었어?”  
English: “Have you eaten?”

They mean the same thing.

But in Korean, it is used as a greeting.
In English, it is a literal question.

**What does “same meaning” mean?**

---

### **#010 [Mirror]**

Mirrors are said to flip left and right.

Then why don’t they flip up and down?

In reality, mirrors do not flip left and right.
They flip front and back.

**Why does it feel like left and right are flipped?**

---

### **#011 [Stairs]**

Climbing stairs up to the 10th floor is tiring.
Going down from the 10th floor is less tiring.

Same stairs.
Same height difference.

**What is different? And where is that difference?**

---

### **#012 [Waiting]**

Waiting 5 minutes for a bus feels short.
A bus being 5 minutes late feels long.

Same 5 minutes.

Someone says, “I always lie.”

Is this statement true or false?

**How is this different from #005?**

---

### **#014 [Speed]**

It does not change
whether the observer moves,

Instead, time and space change.

**To keep something constant, something else must change.  
Where does this structure appear elsewhere?**

---

There is a line that separates inside and outside.

Does the line belong to the inside?

You must explain “red” to someone.

They have been blind since birth.

**Is explanation possible? If not, why not?**

---

### **#019 [Rule]**

“All rules have exceptions.”

Does this rule have an exception?

If it does → there exists a rule without exceptions  
If it doesn’t → this rule itself has no exception

**How do we escape this?**

---

### **#020 [Ship]**

There is the Ship of Theseus.

Its parts are replaced one by one.

There are infinitely many numbers between 1 and 2.
There are infinitely many numbers between 2 and 3.

These infinities are the same size.

and the set of real numbers
are infinities of different sizes.

**What does it mean for infinity to have size?**

---

### **#029 [Observation]**

When you observe, the result changes. (quantum mechanics)

If you don’t observe, you don’t know the result.

**If observing changes the result,  
what is the “original state”?**

To learn something you don’t know,

---

### **#044 [Meta]**

#041, #042, and #043 are different from the others.

They are not about a problem,
but about the problems themselves.

**Why include problems like this?**

---

### **#045 [End]**

This collection ends at #050.

Why 50?

**Who decides what an “end” is?**

---

### **#046 [Answer]**

Is that really true?

Or is “there is no answer” the answer?

**Is this the same structure as #005, or different?**

---

### **#047 [Solving]**
