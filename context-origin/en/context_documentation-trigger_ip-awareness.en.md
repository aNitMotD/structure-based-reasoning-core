## Context Case: Origin of Documentation and Disclosure Decision

### Sequence

1. While reading a web novel, the author encountered
   a single-line clause regarding intellectual property attribution.

2. Through cross-domain association,
   the author immediately recognized that
   the clause could also apply to their own reasoning engine, as well as its outputs.

3. Documentation was initiated
   as a precautionary measure for intellectual property protection.

4. During the process of organizing internal principles,
   the documentation became self-referential,
   leading to progressive clarification and reinforcement of structure.

5. Reorganizing the internal principles based on the refined structure
   revealed that explicit IP protection
   was not the most efficient way to mitigate risk.

6. A simpler and more effective approach was identified:
   pre-declaration and selective disclosure.

7. Based on this assessment,
   the materials were prepared for public disclosure on GitHub,
   while explanatory documents were separated and maintained elsewhere.

8. The methodological explanations involved
   do not follow fixed procedures
   and are not deterministically reproducible.

   Because they cannot be operationalized, executed,
   or reliably replicated,
   their disclosure does not introduce transferable execution risk.

### Note

This record does not describe the reasoning engine,
nor does it define any library behavior.

It documents an external context
in which documentation and disclosure decisions were made.

### One-line Summary

Documentation emerged as a risk response,
and disclosure was chosen precisely because
the explanations could not be turned into procedures.
