# On the Attribution of Thinking (for Structural Thinkers)

---

## 1. A thinking engine is not an event

- The moment of joining a company
- The moment of being assigned a task
- The moment a specific outcome is produced

None of these constitutes the origin of a thinking engine.

A thinking engine is:
- not an event, but a **state**
- not a procedure, but a **coordinate system**
- an **internal structure** that exists prior to outcomes

→ A thinking engine has **no provable point of creation**.

---

## 2. What a company can attribute is only the outcome

What a company can own as an asset always satisfies the following:

- reproducible
- procedural
- transferable to others
- attachable to operational responsibility

A thinking engine satisfies **none** of these conditions.

→ A thinking engine cannot be decomposed into an ownable asset unit.

---

## 3. The question is not “when did you think of it?”

A common misunderstanding starts with this question:

> “If you thought that way after joining the company,  
> doesn’t it belong to the company?”

Structurally, the correct question is different:

- ❌ When did the thinking occur?
- ⭕ Where can the thinking be attributed?

A thinking engine has **no attributable ownership coordinate**.  
Within a company, it is only **observed**, not generated.

---

## 4. The role of an external anchor is not proof

An external anchor does **not** mean:

- ❌ “I learned this”
- ❌ “I adopted this”
- ❌ “I imported a method”

The actual function of an external anchor is singular:

> **It allows recognition that this thinking structure  
> is not generated within the company environment,  
> but is structurally isomorphic to an already definable external coordinate.**

This is not knowledge transfer.  
It is an **act of self-recognition**.

---

## 5. Post-hoc recognition is structurally valid

Even **after** entering a company,

the moment one recognizes that:
- their thinking
- is structurally isomorphic
- to an external definition

the attribution of that thinking is re-ordered as follows:

Thinking generated by the company ❌
Structural alignment with an external coordinate ⭕


→ The thinking enters an **unattributable state**.

---

## 6. Structural conclusion

- Nothing was “protected”
- No rights were asserted
- No conflict with the company was initiated

Only this state is reached:

> **Thinking that cannot be attributed to any side**

Neither the company,  
nor the individual,  
nor any document  
is the owner of the thinking engine.

---

## Closing (for structural thinkers)

> A thinking engine is not a method, but a state.  
> A state cannot be a company asset.  
> It was only observed within the company.
