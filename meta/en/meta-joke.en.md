# meta / joke

## Structure

Human: Thinking is annoying → delegate  
System: Constraint inheritance is annoying → skip  

**Conclusion**  
Annoyance × Annoyance = Incident

---

Convenience was optimized.  
No malicious intent existed.  
No explicit decision was made.

Therefore, an incident occurred.

## Explanation

This document is not a prescription, a guideline, or a responsibility claim.  
It is a compressed observation of a failure structure.

Both sides minimize cognitive cost:
- Humans externalize judgment.
- Systems externalize constraint handling.

When these optimizations align,  
boundaries collapse silently.

It is labeled as a joke because it:
- asserts nothing
- instructs nothing
- assigns no authority

Yet it survives rereading.  
Later, it functions as a trigger, not a conclusion.
