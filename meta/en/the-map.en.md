# The Map

A map records the terrain.

---

## The Map

It marks what exists.  
It shows where the ground is solid,  
where the path ends,  
where cliffs and swamps begin.

A map says only this:

> “I have been here.”

And just as importantly:

> “Beyond this point is unverified.”

## What the Map Does

- It records confirmed ground  
- It fixes boundaries  
- It distinguishes fact from assumption  
- It preserves context without interpretation

The map is a record of **where observation ends**.

---

## What the Map Does Not Do

A map does not:

- Promise treasure  
- Choose a route  
- Judge which path is correct  
- Guarantee success or safety

The map does not turn possibility into outcome.

---

## Responsibility

- The mapmaker is responsible for accuracy  
- The mapmaker is responsible for marking limits  
- The mapmaker is **not** responsible for where others go

Reading a map does not transfer responsibility.

---

## Misuse of the Map

If the map says:

> “This is the only way,”

it is no longer a map.

It becomes a guide.  
And a guide assumes responsibility.

A proper map refuses that role.

---

## Closing

The map shows where the land is known.  
It does not tell you where to go.

Finding treasure  
is not the mapmaker’s task.

The map simply exists.

That is enough.
