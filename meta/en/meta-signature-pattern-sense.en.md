# meta-signature-pattern-sense

## 1. Concept Definition

**Meta-Signature-Pattern-Sense (MSPS)** refers to a  
**pre-structural sensing layer** that exists  
prior to differences in sensory intensity, preference, or normality.

This layer does not classify sensory content.  
It only returns **when and where signals relevant to judgment occur**.

## 2. Minimal Structural Coordinates (Core Axes)

MSPS is described using the following **four coordinate axes**.

### A. Detection Target
- Continuous variation
- Outlier / hazard
- Rate of change / timing
- Identity signature

### B. Activation Phase
- Pre-emotional
- Pre-judgment
- Pre-action
- Post-action verification

### C. Functional Intent
- Pleasure
- Avoidance
- Branching judgment
- Responsibility blocking

### D. Output Signal
- Subtle sensation
- Immediate avoidance
- Hesitation / hold
- Uncertain warning

> While sensory contents differ,  
> MSPS is always projected onto some point within these four axes.

## 3. Operational Flow

signature / pattern detection  
→ output signal generation  
→ structuring  
→ judgment  
→ responsibility attribution

MSPS is **an input to structure**,  
not structure itself.

## 4. Distinction from Structural Sense

### Signature / Pattern Sense (MSPS)
- Prior to explanation
- Immediate discrimination
- Reasonless “same / different / dangerous”

### Structural Sense
- Modeling of relations, constraints, and boundaries
- Can be verbalized
- Post-hoc explanation possible

## 5. Individual Case (Example)

> The following is **one observed case** illustrating  
> how MSPS may be projected in practice.  
> It is not a general rule.

### Taste
- Detection target: continuous variation
- Intent: compositional decomposition
- Output: subtle sense of incongruity

### Smell
- Detection target: outlier / hazard
- Intent: immediate avoidance
- Output: strong blocking signal

### Vision
- Detection target: rate of change / timing
- Intent: branching judgment
- Output: readiness for immediate response

### Hearing
- Detection target: identity signature
- Intent: early path discrimination
- Output: certainty of “this is that”

### Touch
- Detection target: discontinuity at contact boundaries
- Intent: fixation of causal location
- Output: immediate recognition signal

## 6. Conclusion

While sensory experiences vary widely,  
**the position at which sensation attaches to judgment structures is coordinatizable**.

MSPS does not classify sensations.  
It only describes **when, for what purpose, and what kind of signal** a sensation emits.

> **MSPS is an input to structure.  
> Its activation is determined by the matching between an individual’s binding format and data characteristics,  
> and level assessment is based not on ratios, but on whether a transition occurs.**
