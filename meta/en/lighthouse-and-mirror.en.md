# The Lighthouse and the Mirror

The sea is a mirror.

## The Sea

It has no end.  
Everyone sails on their own.  
Each must face it alone.

## The Mirror

When you look at the sea, you see yourself reflected.  
What you see is not the sea, but yourself.  
Whether you face it or avoid it is each person’s choice.

## The Lighthouse

It blinks in the vast ocean.  
“This is the direction.”  
That’s all.

---

The lighthouse does not save the ship.  
It does not know where the ship is going.  
Even if the ship arrives, it does not say, “Well done.”

It just blinks.

---

But without that blinking,  
you wouldn’t even know where land is,  
and you would drift.

## The Role of This Repository

- It exists  
- It shines light  
- It shows direction  
- It does not pull the ship along

For those who have begun to seek their own answers,  
it blinks in the vast ocean.

That’s all.

## Notice

You may reach land by following the lighthouse.  
But the lighthouse is not the destination.

If you look at the lighthouse and say,  
“That is the answer,”  
you are using the lighthouse incorrectly.

The lighthouse is a direction, not an arrival point.
