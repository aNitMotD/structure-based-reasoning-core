# MSPS Post-Processing Notes

## Position Statement
- **Continuity / trajectory perception is not an axis of MSPS**
- It belongs to an **interpretation (post-processing) layer after MSPS output**
- MSPS returns discrete detection events;  
  continuity is classified as a **difference in post-processing style** when interpreting those outputs

---

## Post-Processing Style Differences
Individuals may differ in how they interpret MSPS outputs.

### 1. Continuous Interpretation
- Perceives a trajectory as **a single signal**
- The process of change itself is treated as a perceptual unit
- Temporal intervals are included in the perceptual content

### 2. Discrete / Snapshot Interpretation
- Perceives state changes as **events**
- Does not sense temporal intervals; only **transition points** are detected
- Experienced as “static → static” snapshot transitions

## Position of the Olfactory Case
- Perfume note transitions (Top → Middle → Base)  
  are not used to assert continuity itself
- They serve as **observational examples where the boundary between post-processing styles becomes explicit**
- Therefore, olfactory cases are fixed as **boundary-revealing observations**, not as general rules

---

## Key Summary
- MSPS describes **“when and what was detected”**
- Continuity / persistence is not a property of detection, but **a mode of interpretation**
- Not sensing temporal intervals, but detecting **state transitions**,  
  is an equally valid interpretation mode
