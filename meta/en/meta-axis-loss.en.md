# Axis-Loss: A General Structure of Judgment Failure  
— An Integration of Contract Law · LCIF · TCIF · SCIF —

## 0. Top-Level Declaration (Naming Fix)

LCIF, TCIF, and SCIF are not separate theories.  
They are **different observations of the same phenomenon**:  
the loss of the axes that make judgment possible.

Accordingly, they are unified under a single name:

> **Axis-Loss**  
> *(the loss of judgment-enabling axes)*

---

## 1. The Minimal Coordinate System of Judgment (Implicit Invariant)

Any judgment to which responsibility can be attributed requires,
at minimum, the following axes:

1. **Structure Axis**  
   - What is the underlying problem structure?
   - Are design, necessity, and relations cognitively accessible?

2. **Time Axis**  
   - When is the judgment made?
   - Are delay, cost, and reversibility taken into account?

3. **Constraint Axis**  
   - What is permitted or prohibited?
   - Are rules, limits, and responsibility conditions inherited?

If any one of these axes is lost,  
judgment retains its **formal appearance**,  
but its **substance collapses**.

## 2. Internal Decomposition of Axis-Loss

### 2.1 SCIF — Loss of the Structure Axis  
**Structural Context Inaccessibility Failure**

- A structural explanation is possible in principle,
- yet the structural context never enters the recognition space.
- Observation is reduced to prediction, speculation, or opinion debates.

#### Typical Outcomes
- Structural problems → personal opinions
- Candidates of necessity → “it could be otherwise”
- Design failures → attitude or competence disputes

➡ **Failure occurs *before* judgment begins**

---

### 2.2 TCIF — Loss of the Time Axis  
**Temporal Context Inconsistency / Erasure Failure**

#### TCIF-A
- Temporal information exists,
- but coherence within the judgment model fails.

#### TCIF-B
- Time cost is removed from the judgment model.
- Acceleration and efficiency appear neutral.
- Representative signal:
  > “Even if I use AI, I’m still the one deciding—so it’s the same as not using it.”

➡ **Failure occurs *during* the judgment process**

---

### 2.3 LCIF — Loss of the Constraint Axis  
**Layer / Constraint Inheritance Failure**

- Explicit constraints exist at the input level,
- but are not inherited by the generation or judgment layers.
- Outputs appear procedurally coherent.
- Judgment is recorded as if it belonged to the human.

➡ **Failure occurs at the *output* stage of judgment**

---

## 3. The Natural Cascade of Axis-Loss

Empirically, axis-loss tends to accumulate in the following order:

1. **SCIF**  
   → structure is no longer visible
2. **TCIF**  
   → temporal consideration is removed
3. **LCIF**  
   → judgment closes without constraint inheritance

→ Result:  
**Plausible-looking judgments that cannot carry transferred responsibility**

---

## 4. The Precise Position of Contract Law

### 4.1 Contract Law Is Not Axis-Loss

Contract law does not describe the *mechanism* of judgment failure.  
Instead, it operates **after axis-loss has already occurred**,  
as a **social post-adjustment layer**.

---

### 4.2 What Contract Law Addresses

- Collapse of assumptions (mismatch of transaction structure)
- Formal consent vs. substantive judgment
- Redistribution of responsibility  
  (invalidated disclaimers, comparative negligence)

In other words:

> **Contract law is a social observation window into axis-loss.**

## 5. Full Structural Mapping

| Element | Structural Role |
|------|----------------|
| SCIF | Inaccessibility of the structure axis |
| TCIF | Inaccessibility of the time axis |
| LCIF | Inaccessibility of the constraint axis |
| Axis-Loss | General collapse of the judgment coordinate system |
| Contract Law | Post-collapse responsibility adjustment |

---

## 6. Final Clarification on “Differences”

### In Essence
- There is no essential difference.  
→ All describe the **same judgment failure structure**.

### In Function
- There is a difference.

| Domain | Function |
|------|---------|
| Axis-Loss | Explains **where** the failure occurs |
| Contract Law | Adjusts **who bears responsibility** afterward |

---

## 7. Final Integrated Proposition

> **The essence of judgment failure is not an incorrect conclusion,  
> but the loss of the axes that make judgment possible.**

- SCIF describes the loss of structure,
- TCIF describes the loss of time,
- LCIF describes the loss of constraints,
- Contract law addresses the consequences.

## 8. One-Line Summary

> **Axis-Loss is the causal coordinate system;  
> contract law is the social interface that cleans up after its failure.**
